# Module-20

In this Module, I looked at building a smart contract using solidity. This smart contract acts as a Joint Savings account with two users

## Tools

In this module I used the Remix IDE, an online browser-based IDE for solidity. 


## Functionality and Results

The code for this contract is in the file "JointSavings.sol"

This contract has the ability to deposit ETH into it. The image below reflects a deposit of 5 ETH.

I can also deposit wei to the contract.

I have also added 10 ETH to this contract.

Then we can set up the owners of this account.

Once the owners are set up, we can withdraw money.

You will get an error if you are not one of the owners.

There are other functions, such as looking at the contract balance.
